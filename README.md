# Custom Web server

This is a pure Java implementation of a multithreaded web server written by me from scratch which can serve 10 concurrent requests. This project uses the socket programming Java API from the java.net package

## Demo

https://github.com/aryak0512/socket-programming/assets/57310005/75916e0b-bf57-42f8-8a42-6ead2c697315
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aryak0512/socket-programming.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd socket-programming
```

Install JDK 11

Start the server. Right click -> Server.java -> Run as Java Application. Server is ready to accept requests on port 7200.


## Deployment

To build this project run

```bash
  java -jar webserver.jar
```
